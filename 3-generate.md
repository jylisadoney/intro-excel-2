# Generate PivotTables

In Excel, a PivotTable is a special type of table that allows you to summarize data and identify patterns, trends, or interesting comparisons.

## Insert a PivotTable
First, let's navigate to the `Employee Sales sheet (or Sheet1)` in our workbook.
* Highlight all of our data
  * Option 1: Click on `Cell A1` and drag to highlight all data **OR**
  * Option 2: Hit `Ctrl A` on your keyboard (`Command A` for Mac users)
* Navigate to the `Insert` tab and the `Tables` section
* Click on `PivotTable`
* Under `Choose the data you want to analyze`, confirm that:
  * `Select a table or range` is selected
  * Verify that cell range in the `Table/Range` box is correct
* Under the `Choose where` options, select `New Worksheet`
* Click OK

## Build a PivotTable

After inserting a blank PivotTable, we can now build a report (or PivotTable) based on the data.

PivotTables contain four areas:
* Values
  * Fields you want to `measure`
* Columns
  * Headings that represent your selected `values` 
* Rows
  * Fields you want to use to `group and categorize` your data
* Filters
  * Fields you want to use to `isolate or focus` your data
