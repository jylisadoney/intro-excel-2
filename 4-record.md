# Record Macros

If you frequently use Excel to work with similar worksheets and find yourself doing the same tasks again and again, `macros` can help you automate those tasks.

`Macros` allow you to record specific actions and clicks and then run that `macro` in other workbooks.

This lesson will show you how to [create a macro](#create-a-macro) and share a few [help hints about macros](#helpful-hints-about-macros).

## [Create a macro](#create-a-macro)

The `macro` tool is located under the `Developer` tab in Excel, which is hidden by default.

## Enable the developer tab

To enable the `Developer` tab:
* Click on `File`
* Click on `Options`
* Click on `Customize Ribbon`
* Under `Main Tabs`, click on the box for `Developer`
* Click OK

We can now see the `Developer` tab at the top of our Excel workbook.

## Record a macro

Let's navigate to the `Employee Sales sheet (or Sheet1)` in our workbook.
